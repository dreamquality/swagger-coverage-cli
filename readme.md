## Introduction

**swagger-coverage-cli** is a tool that helps you **measure how much of your OpenAPI/Swagger-documented API is actually covered by your Postman tests**. It reads inputs from:

1. **Single or Multiple OpenAPI/Swagger** specifications (version 2 or 3) in either JSON or YAML format, or **CSV** files containing API documentation.
2. A **Postman** collection (JSON) that contains requests and test scripts, **OR** a **Newman run report** (JSON) that contains actual execution results.

The tool supports processing **multiple API specifications in a single run**, making it ideal for organizations managing multiple APIs or microservices. Using this information, the CLI **calculates a unified coverage percentage** and produces a **detailed HTML report** indicating which endpoints and status codes are validated across all APIs, and which are missing tests.

---

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Simple CLI interface with just two main arguments (the Swagger file and the Postman collection or Newman report).
- **Multiple Input Types**: Supports both Postman collections and Newman run reports for maximum flexibility.
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects Newman report format even without explicit flags.
- **Multiple API Support**: Process multiple Swagger/OpenAPI specifications in a single run for comprehensive API portfolio management.
- **Unified Reporting**: Generate consolidated reports that show coverage across all APIs while maintaining individual API identification.
- **Strict Matching (Optional)**: Enforce strict checks for query parameters, request bodies, and more.
- **HTML Reports**: Generates `coverage-report.html` that shows which endpoints are covered and which are not.
- **Extensible**: Modular code structure (Node.js) allows customization of matching logic, query parameter checks, status code detection, etc.
- **CSV Support**: Allows API documentation to be provided in a CSV format for flexibility and ease of use.
- **Unit Tested**: Includes Jest tests for the core functions that match endpoints to Postman requests.

## How It Works (Diagram)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[OpenAPI/Swagger Spec] --> B[Load & Parse Spec]
    C[Postman Collection] --> D[Load & Parse Collection]
    B --> E[Match Operations]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Calculate Coverage]
    F --> G[Generate HTML & Console Report]
```

1. Load & Parse Spec/CSV: The CLI reads your Swagger (YAML or JSON) or CSV file and extracts all documented operations (method, path, status codes, parameters, requestBody details, etc.).
2. Load & Parse Collection: The CLI reads your Postman collection (JSON) to gather all requests, their URLs, methods, test scripts, and any explicitly tested status codes.
3. *Match Operations: The tool compares each documented operation with each Postman request to see if itâ€™s covered (based on path patterns, method, status codes tested, and optional strict checks on parameters and body).
4. Calculate Coverage: It counts how many documented API operations are matched with Postman tests vs. how many total operations are defined in your spec or CSV.
5. Generate Report: Prints a summary to the console and creates an HTML file (by default coverage-report.html) with matched and unmatched endpoints.

## Multi-API Support

**swagger-coverage-cli** now supports processing multiple Swagger/OpenAPI specifications in a single run, making it perfect for organizations managing multiple APIs or microservices.

### Usage

To analyze multiple APIs, provide comma-separated file paths:

```bash
swagger-coverage-cli "api1.yaml,api2.yaml,api3.json" collection.json
```

### Features

- **Unified Coverage Report**: Get a single report showing coverage across all APIs
- **API Identification**: Each operation in the report is tagged with its source API
- **Individual API Breakdown**: The report header shows both the combined API list and individual API names
- **Separate Operation Tracking**: Operations with the same path/method from different APIs are tracked separately
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Single API mode works exactly as before

### Example Output

When processing multiple APIs, the console output will show:

```
=== Swagger Coverage Report ===
APIs analyzed: User API, Product API, Order API
Total operations in spec(s): 24
Matched operations in Postman: 18
Coverage: 75.00%

Unmatched Spec operations:
 - [User API] [GET] /users/{id}/profile (statusCode=404)
 - [Product API] [POST] /products (statusCode=400)
 - [Order API] [DELETE] /orders/{id} (statusCode=204)
```

The HTML report will include:
- **API column** in the operations table to identify the source API
- **Combined API information** in the report header
- **Individual API breakdown** for detailed analysis

## Installation & Requirements

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** version 12+ (16+ recommended).
- **NPM** (or Yarn) installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone** or **download** this repository.
2. **Install dependencies** by running:

```bash
npm install -g swagger-coverage-cli



```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Prepare Your Files

You will need:

1. **OpenAPI/Swagger** specification file (e.g., `openapi.yaml` or `swagger.json`) OR CSV documentation file following the specified format.
2. **Postman** collection file (JSON format), which you can export from the Postman app, **OR** a **Newman run report** (JSON format) generated by running your collection with Newman.

> **Note**: 
> - If using a Postman collection, make sure it includes actual test scripts that assert or check specific status codes (e.g., `pm.response.to.have.status(200)`).
> - If using a Newman report, the tool will extract actual response codes and test results from the execution data.

### 2. Run the CLI

Use the following command:

```bash
npm swagger-coverage-cli <swaggerFile> <postmanCollectionOrNewmanReport> [options]

```

**For Multiple APIs:**

```bash
npm swagger-coverage-cli "api1.yaml,api2.yaml,api3.json" collection.json [options]

```

**Examples:**

**With Postman Collection:**
```bash
npm swagger-coverage-cli openapi.yaml collection.json --verbose --strict-query --strict-body

```

**With Newman Report:**
```bash
npm swagger-coverage-cli openapi.yaml newman-report.json --newman --verbose

```

**Multiple APIs with Newman Report:**
```bash
npm swagger-coverage-cli "users-api.yaml,products-api.yaml" newman-report.json --newman --output multi-api-report.html

```

**Options**:

- `--verbose`: Display additional logs (helpful for debugging).
- `--newman`: Treat input file as Newman run report instead of Postman collection.
- `--strict-query`: Enforce strict checks on query parameters (e.g., required params, `enum`, `pattern`, etc.).
- `--strict-body`: Verify that `application/json` request bodies in the spec match raw JSON bodies in Postman requests.
- `--output <file>`: Customize the name of the HTML report file (default is `coverage-report.html`).

### Run via NPM Script

```bash
npm swagger-coverage-cli -- <swaggerFile> <postmanCollectionOrNewmanReport> [options]


```

### 3. Check the Coverage Report

After execution, you will see:

1. **Console Output**:

```bash
=== Swagger Coverage Report ===
Total operations in spec: 12
Matched operations in Postman: 9
Coverage: 75.00%

Unmatched operations:
- [DELETE] /items/{id} (statusCode=204)
- [PUT] /items/{id} (statusCode=400)
...



```

2. **HTML Report**:
   - A file named `coverage-report.html` (or the name you provided with `--output`) is generated.
   - Open it in your browser to see a table of matched/unmatched operations with color highlights.

## Detailed Matching Logic

**swagger-coverage-cli** tries to match each **operation** from the spec with a **request** in Postman. An operation is considered **covered** if:

1. **HTTP Method** matches exactly (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.).
2. **Path**:

   - The path pattern from Swagger (e.g., `/users/{id}`) is converted to a regex (like `^/users/[^/]+$`).
   - The Postman request URL (minus any base URL placeholders like `{{baseUrl}}`) must match that regex.

3. **Status Code**:

   - If the spec operation has a specific status code (e.g., `200`, `404`), the CLI checks the Postman test scripts to see if that status code is asserted (e.g., `pm.response.to.have.status(200)`).

4. **Query Parameters** (only if `--strict-query` is enabled):

   - If the spec says a query parameter is required and has certain constraints (e.g., `enum`, `pattern`, `type`), the tool verifies that the Postman request includes that parameter and meets the constraints.

5. **Request Body** (only if `--strict-body` is enabled):

   - If the spec says `requestBody` includes `application/json`, the CLI checks if the Postman request body is raw JSON and can be parsed without errors.

If all criteria are satisfied, the operation is **matched** (covered). Otherwise, itâ€™s reported as **unmatched**.

## Supported File Formats

**Swagger/OpenAPI/.csv**:

- **JSON** or **YAML**
- **OpenAPI v2 (Swagger 2.0)** or **OpenAPI v3.x**
- **CSV**: API documentation can be provided in CSV format following the specified structure.

**Postman**:

- **Postman collection** in **JSON** format (v2.1 or higher recommended).
   - Typically exported via the Postman app: *File â†’ Export â†’ Collection*.

**Newman Reports**:

- **Newman run report** in **JSON** format.
   - Generated by running: `newman run collection.json --reporters json --reporter-json-export newman-report.json`

### Postman Collection vs Newman Report

The tool supports two types of input for test data:

#### Postman Collection
- **What it is**: The collection definition containing requests and test scripts
- **Pros**: 
  - Contains all test logic and assertions
  - Can extract expected status codes from test scripts
- **Cons**: 
  - No actual execution data
  - Relies on parsing test scripts to understand expected outcomes

#### Newman Report  
- **What it is**: Actual execution results from running a Postman collection with Newman
- **Pros**: 
  - Contains real execution data with actual response codes
  - Includes assertion results (passed/failed)
  - More accurate representation of what was actually tested
  - Includes response times and execution metadata
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires an additional step to generate the report

**Recommendation**: Use Newman reports when possible for more accurate coverage analysis, especially in CI/CD pipelines where collections are actually executed.

### Using CSV for Documentation

In addition to traditional OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, **swagger-coverage-cli** supports API documentation provided in a **CSV** format. This allows for a more flexible and easily editable documentation process, especially for teams that prefer spreadsheet-based documentation.

#### CSV Structure

Your CSV file should adhere to the following structure to ensure compatibility with **swagger-coverage-cli**:

1. **Header Row**: The first row must contain the following columns in **exactly** this order:

```sh
METHOD,URI,NAME,STATUS CODE,BODY,TAGS

```

2. **Data Rows**: Each subsequent row represents an API endpoint response with data corresponding to the headers.

#### Column Descriptions

- **METHOD**

   - **Type:** String
   - **Description:** The HTTP method used for the API endpoint (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).

- **URI**

   - **Type:** String
   - **Description:** The endpoint's URI path (e.g., `/api/products`).

- **NAME**

   - **Type:** String
   - **Description:** A descriptive name for the API endpoint action (e.g., `getProducts`).

- **STATUS CODE**

   - **Type:** Integer
   - **Description:** The HTTP status code returned by the API (e.g., `200`, `400`).

- **BODY**

   - **Type:** String (JSON format)
   - **Description:** The response body returned by the API in JSON format. Ensure that JSON strings are properly escaped.

- **TAGS**

   - **Type:** String
   - **Description:** Tags associated with the endpoint for categorization and filtering (e.g., `products`).

#### Example CSV

Below is an example of how your `documentation.csv` should be structured:

```csv
METHOD,URI,NAME,STATUS CODE,BODY,TAGS
GET,/api/products,getProducts,200,"{\"products\":\"updated\"}","products"
GET,/api/products,getProducts,400,"{\"error\":\"Invalid query parameters\"}","products"
```
